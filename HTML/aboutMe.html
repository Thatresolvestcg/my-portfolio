      <h2>Whoami?</h2>
      <p>
        I am a Test Engineer working for a well known manchester based technology company. 
        I am currently enrolled in a developer bootcamp so that I can enhance my technical skills and move my career to the next level.   
        One of the best things I have learned whilst on this course is how to use the command line properly especially with git.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my spare time I am a content creator for a digital card game, which is just about to get released for the Nintendo Switch.
        I am starting to become a huge fan of the Nintendo Switch and I am starting to use that more than my desktop PC for gaming which I now mostly use for development work. 
      </p>
      <p>The plan for this webapp is to use it as a portfolio and develop it over time. My next plan is to make the webapp responsive and more accessibile.</p>

      <h2>Learning</h2>
      <p>Currently I am focusing on learning about JavaScript I've only implemented anything of note on the <a href="./contact-page.html" target="_blank">Contact Page</a> but I am hoping to remedy this soon.
      The next piece of JavaScript I'm looking to add will be something that cycles through images on each of the pages.</p>
